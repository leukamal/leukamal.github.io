 In Building 6B, NIH campus at Bethesda MD, the animal caretaker were changing about 420 cages every day, this was a lot of labor and also a lot of supply more than our local storage can hold given the fact that we had about 15000 mice which could translate into about 3000 or more cages to change every week, if we go base on the fact that we will house about 5 mice per cage. 

This process will consume a big chunk of the time leaving less time to the caretaker to conduct good quality health check on the research's animals. The main problem was related to the size of the water bottle used and also on the size of the sipper tubes from where the mice will drink. 

A company X has designed a new water bottle with pink hole. I was tasked by the veterinarian to see how long 5 cages using our regular water bottle will last versus 5 cages using the new bottles. 

On average the new bottles lasted almost two weeks and the mice in these cages were as healthy as their counterpart in the old water bottle.

 The next step was to do a pilot study in one room with one caretaker. He has an  1400 cages in his room. I divided the room in two (700 cage with old water bottles and 700 with new water bottles): I recorded the number of clinical cases reported, the number of wet cages. On average the number of wet cages to be change with the old water bottles was double of the water bottle with pinholes meaning more clinical reports written. 

The cages with pinholes been changed every other week, the labor part for changing was cut down in two and the caretaker has more time to actually perform health check on the mice. I extrapolate my finding to the whole facility using excel for data entries and data visualization. I did a power point presentation showing side by side the benefit of the pinhole water bottles versus the regular bottle. The idea of the pinhole was adopted and the whole facility transitioned and our mice were healthier and the caretakers happier and more motivated.
