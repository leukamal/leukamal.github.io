To stay focus and sharp we need to consistently pushing ourselves to learn new concepts. My journey in the data science field is linked to this quest to acquire and understand new concepts. 

Prior to my enrolment at Flatiron for the boot camp, data science was a mysterious field reserved to a different kind of human being. With constant work and adding more concepts to all the one acquired while going to the online boot camp, my vocabulary has improved in regard to the field and the way I view, treat or use data has changed a lot; even when I am listening or reading news linked to data, I can relate to the story and will not be clueless. 

The world has changed a lot, making it easy to everybody to be able to learn whatever they want no matter what background they may have.
