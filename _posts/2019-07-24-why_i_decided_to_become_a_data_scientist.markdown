From 1996 thru 2001 I have taught Mathematics and physics in High School in my home country after graduating from Yaounde University with a Bachelor Degree in Physics in 1996. I travelled to the USA in 2001. I start to look for opportunity in the teaching field but quickly changed my mind and went into the field of laboratory animal research. I have worked in this field for the last 17 years.  Why trying to switch career after such a long period in the research field?
I grew up in a country where access to the computer was a luxury not affordable to many including me. I was exposed to a computer for the first time after graduating from University. Back then, I was fascinated by what could be accomplished with a computer. I educated myself about using word, excel and even Power point. While working as Research assistant, I was still very intrigued with the computer world. I started to thinking about career change, becoming an IT professional: I have a formal training in Computer Network. This didn't translate into a job gain because of lack of experience. When I was let go from my last job, I started to think about what to really do with my life and I read a story about coding boot camps and how it was possible to be trained there and get a reliable job security. I look up all the jobs related to coding and Data Science was the career path that interested me the most: data are everywhere and the companies out there will always need somebody to help them with their data.
