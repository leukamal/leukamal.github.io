**Problem: can we evaluate the success of training in a corporate setting?**

Giving the fact that Companies put a lot of money, time, and hard work to train employees, I am attempting to set up an evaluation system that will determine whether the training effort is actually making a difference. I will start by stating that the goal for training in any given field is to ensure that the employees are compliant, have better job performance, work safely and are successful. 

**Idea: survey participants in various trainings and record their score**

I have a background in data science, just graduated from Flatiron online training Bootcamp in data science. I am using this new skill couple with my experience in the workforce to collect data in the various sectors involve in my training evaluation and every 6 months the data will be analyzed and a report produces indicating if the training program need to be re-tune or no. The tables below will be used to collect the data.

		| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| John     | Doe      | Male     |
| Mary     | Smith    | Female   |

         

  I will  assign a scale of 1 thru 5 to each category: 

The data can be collected by randomly interviewing participant in various trainings and record their score as the average of numbers in various categories. Once the data is generated I can do some visualization that will allow me to determine how effective the training was.

This is a work in progress; anyone who has an idea on how to improve this is more than welcome to post his comment.
In my next post I will generate random data to do a simulation.
