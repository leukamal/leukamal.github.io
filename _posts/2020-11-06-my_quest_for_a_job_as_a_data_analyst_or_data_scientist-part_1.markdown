I have been working in the research field for almost 17 years, moving from the entry level to a mid-level position on a course of 11 years. I have stayed in the mid-level position for almost 6 years and decided to look for a higher level position.

I started to put my resume out for a position as Assistant Project Manager or Project Manager. Eventually I was hired in a mid-size biotechnology company as a Project Manager overseeing short term and long term project for them. After 3 months with them, I was discharged for no apparent reason except for doing my job of ensuring the wellbeing of one of the subject under research. 

The discharge itself triggers the need to do something different; I started to think about long-term strategy. I have been fascinated by mathematic, statistic and Data all my life, why not converting that fascination into a career. I started to look for a program where I could learn Data Science. I came across Flatiron 15 month’s boot camp; I start the learning with them and was able to finish the program.

Completing the program by itself doesn’t seem to be the hardest, but to get a job is the most challenging part so far. In a subsequent post, I will expand on the steps and the difficulties encounter while applying for a Data Analyst or Data Scientist positions.
