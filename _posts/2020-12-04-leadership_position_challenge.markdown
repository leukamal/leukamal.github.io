Every position in the work environment comes with its difficulties. The leadership position is more complicated especially when you are not on top but somewhere in the middle: let say you are a supervisor with a senior above you. 
You have to deal with people under you, the senior above you and some time the Manager above the senior may bypass the senior and comes straight to you. Add the customers to this and you have a good formula or some stress if you are unable to handle pressure.

I have been working in such position for almost seven years now and I have built a mental armor to protect me against all these stressors coming from multiple directions. My motto is to be able to justify to the best of my knowledge couple with all the rules and regulations any of the decisions taken.

When you are able to justify why you have acted the way you have acted or explain a decision that you have taken, you earn respect and trust from all people around you; you must also learn how to analyze any situation that occurs with open mind and avoid assumption. When you assume without analyzing, you may jump to conclusion and act in a way that may hurt your credibility.

It definitely takes some experience and maturity to be able to work in some leadership positons and for real some time even though it is rewarding to be in those positions, the pay grade may be small compare to the task involved.
