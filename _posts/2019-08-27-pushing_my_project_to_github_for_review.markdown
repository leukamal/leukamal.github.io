My first project as Data Scientist student at Flaitiron was quiet interesting. This project was related to King County houses sale.

I was so eager to start that I didn’t waste any time. I went thru all the phases: analyzing the data, cleaning, replacing the missing values and so on. 

Doing all what I were doing there is one important thing that I forgot to do all along: I should have tried to push my project at the github website once I have started to work on it.

I have waited to get to the end of my project before doing the push and this didn’t work: I keep having the message that I don’t have the permission to modify the file that I am working on. I reach out to slack, I have two answers from Ryan and Matt, tried again with no luck.

At this point I am stressing out; Matt Sparr reached out to me again we go thru all the steps together: git status, git add, git commit, git push. It works this time but there is a big problem, I am not standing in the right directory, I have pushed the wrong file. 

I went back to the right file followed all the steps as instructed by Matt, still end up with the permission denied. At this point, I saw the message from Abhineet about “the project was not originally linked on the project page in Learn”. At this point it is sounding like I may have to start over. I messaged Abhineet about the problem, he sent me some link to try, I didn’t have any success either. I was somehow stuck then the idea of forking the project again came to my mind and I will copy the code from the old file and paste them in the new one.

That is exactly what I did and was able to push my project into my repository at github. 

In conclusion the working directory it is very important while working on git. Also, it is important while working on lab to be in the habit of pushing our work to our repository more frequently.
