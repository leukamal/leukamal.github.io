I have participated in many mocked interviews where you are asked to write a small code in Python to show your understanding of the language. Been new in this field, this trend has pushed me to think that you probably need to memorize code to be able to get into the field of data. But, I have known people working in the field of Data for long time. I took upon myself to ask them about their own experience.

A friend of mine works in a bank as financial analyst; he believes that it is not useful to try to memorize the code. For  him, be able to work on a project from the beginning to the end, laying out all the steps with explanations is more helpful than trying to memorize the codes if at the end you donâ€™t know how to use them. He has gone so far as to tell me that we cannot re-invent the wheel, we can modify it to fit whichever purpose we want to achieve.

I also participate at a Hackathon online in November 2020; one of the participants, a new grad like me was struggling with the code in Python. The experienced participants told us not to try to memorize the code but to check on the internet. For those, most of the code are out there, you can find them; modify them to fit the purpose of the project you are working on. One went so far as to say he will rather hire a person who will search the internet for solution versus a code memorizer who can be stuck because; he forgot to put a coma somewhere in his code.  

In conclusion, knowing the basic in any programming language will be a good start. Being able to search the internet and adapt the result to the project you are working on will make you a problem solver.

Please let me know your own thoughts.
