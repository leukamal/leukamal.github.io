Data scientists spend a big chunk of their time cleaning data. This is an important mater because data with unclear entries may result into bad analysis and false predictions. 
With false predictions a company or an individual may lost a lot of money. This scenario can be avoided by putting a big push towards making sure the data you’re working with has a high quality. 
Low quality Data may have some of the follow:
•	Missing Data
•	Inconsistent Data
•	Duplicate Data
•	Typos and errors
To Clean Data, Data Scientist can use a few tools.  In my next post I will talk about Python and Pandas as tools for data cleaning.
