I just finished a 15 months Bootcamp in Data Science with Flatiron School. 

Prior to that, I have been working at NIH, Bethesda, Maryland since 2002. I have started at an entry level working in the maintenance Department.  After showing some interest on what the laboratory was doing, I was able to move up the ladder fairly quick. Since 2013, I have bounced from one leadership position to another leadership position. 

During the course of my career, I have collected and analyzed data for the veterinarians and the investigators producing insightful, data-driven strategic recommendations. 
 
During the 15 months Bootcamp in Data Science with Flatiron School, I have successfully conducted 5 projects in data analysis, predictive modeling techniques with a high degree of accuracy. 

I am well versed in a wide variety of software and data management systems ranging from traditional options like Excel and MySQL to newer system like Tableau. I also have a working knowledge of core programming skills using Python or R. 

I'm eager to turn my talent for analyzing big data into high productivity for any company that will be willing to hire me. I will also use my knowledge and capability to identify key data patterns and develop predictive models to help that company achieves its strategic and operational goals.
