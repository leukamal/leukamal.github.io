The last 10 months were really busy for me. I sincerely admire those who are able to manage jobs, school and family. I am a part time student at Flatiron now. I am trying to change career while also taking care of my family. That means be able to work and also spend good quality time with my wife and children. 

On the surface this may seem easy until you start to have some dateline to meet as far as school project or job assignments. While trying to meet all these datelines you still have to make time sometime to take the kids to their soccer practice, piano lessons and so on. To be able to do all of the above you need a drastic change in your old routine.
Success doesn't come without sacrifices. One of the first things to take the hit is the number of hours allocated to your sleeping time. My sleeping time was reduced 7/ 8 hours a night to 4/5 hours. Fortunately, I have the capability to function very well with that amount of sleeping time; all what is needed for instance is just one cup of coffee in the morning to have me going. The next thing to do will be to eliminate unproductive habits such as watching television shows, been on the phone for unnecessary chats or aps surfing. Somebody may think that my life has stopped because I am going to school. No, my life still goes on.

Remember, maintaining the family routine is very important. So, I am still finding a time to take my family out for fun. I am still cooking whenever I can, especially the dishes where my wife and kids think I cook it better than anybody else.

In conclusion, it is challenging to juggle school, job and family but doable. We just need to make a few changes in our daily routine.
