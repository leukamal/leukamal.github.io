I am stuck in a career that seems not to be fulfilling – I am trying to make a shift which isn’t working out how I hope. This is making me nervous and stressed. 

Flatiron provided me with a coach who is offering me the crucial, foundational elements to building a good career in the Data Science field– a career that could be more satisfying and a lot more fun. 

I am still feeling like I am wasting valuable time wondering which way my career could or should go. 

I have to make some crucial decisions on how to build more satisfaction into my current work, as well as working harder towards a great career in a data science field.  

Doing the two things mentioned in the paragraph above either way it goes, will definitely make me be less stressed and make life more enjoyable.
