Histogram visualization is one of the multiple types of visualization used in almost all domains. 

Histograms are very useful when trying to determine if the data is well distributed or not. 

This is my favorite visualization chart because it is easy to understand and interpret. 
When the data is well distributed, the histogram will have the shape of a bell, otherwise it will be either skew to the left or to the right or have some pattern of symmetry.

When plotting Histogram, X-axis is about bin ranges where Y-axis talks about frequency. Before plotting, the number of bins need to be determined. The bins could be of equal size or not.

For illustration purpose, I have imported a few histograms from Microsoft word document.

This histogram has a shape of bell, the data are well distributed

Overall, one visualization may not be good enough for data visualization, we choose them base on what information need to be projected.
