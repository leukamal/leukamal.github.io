Factor contributing to airline delays. What is the biggest contributor?

Which airline has the more delays?

What methodology do I use?

I started by acquiring the data on Kaggle and followed the methodology below:

Data Cleaning:

I have detected and corrected corrupt or inaccurate records from my data; I also identified incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate or irrelevant parts in my data. 

Descriptive analysis:

An important first step for conducting statistical analyses. This gives me an idea of how my data was distributed, helps me detect outliers and typos, and enable me to identify associations among variables, thus making me ready to conduct further statistical analyses.

Feature selection:

I selected the features which contributed most to the airline delays. Departure delay was a major contributor.

Model selection

I have selected a Model from a collection of candidate machine learning models for training my dataset. Random Forest was selected as my best model.

Tuning, training and testing and conclusion

I will talk more about this part in another post.
