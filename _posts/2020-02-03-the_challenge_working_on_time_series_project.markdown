It was quite a journey working on my project of module 04. This project was challenging due to the fact that I have to juggle with many issues at the same time: death in the family, light out at some point, work and school.

I am not looking for sympathy here or pity; I am just venting my feeling out there trying to release the stress I went thru completing this project. As human being, we will always be faced with challenges, obstacles. The way we tackle them will either make us stronger or break us.

When we started module 4, I was very happy because I saw a lot of mathematic while we were coding; at the same time, things started to happen in my family requiring my attention and I was falling behind on my lessons; at some point, I was on the verge on given up altogether. How will I catch up on 4 sections and also be able to be done with the project on time?

Being a father of 2 boys and one girl gave me the courage to do this: I have change my sleeping time, instead of trying to study after work as I use to do, I decide to go to bed early and wake up earlier to study. So, i will sleep from 8 pm to 1 am, study from 1am to 5 am and then go to my job. This schedule has helped me catch up on the lessons and also power thru the project.

I am not giving up my dream to be a data scientist. I must do this. Thank you for reading.
