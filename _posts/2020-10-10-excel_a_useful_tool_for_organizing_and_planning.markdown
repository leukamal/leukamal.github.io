Without being a Scientist in all my previous Jobs, I have been exposed to excel in many ways:

1-Annual Work organization
T
owards the end of each year as a supervisor I used to make a schedule for the whole year using excel. The first thing to was to list all the task for the whole year and start to assign employees either in alphabetical order and rotating each year. I used the same system to establish the weekend schedule for all the employees.

2-Sick log

The sick log was also in excel; this was organized such that each time a new case is added the count will be modified. They were some instances where a coworker will modify the formula and I will have to come along to troubleshoot and figure out what was the problem.

To be continued, my time is almost up, I have to submit this by midnight.
